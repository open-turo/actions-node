# Breaking changes in v7

[//]: # "Upgrade to action-setup-tools@v3. This introduces a major internal refactor by removing custom tool installers in favor of official GitHub setup actions."

## Description of changes

This repository now uses \`action-setup-tools@v3\`, which has dropped support for custom install scripts like \`pyenv\`, \`nodenv\`, \`sdkman\`, and \`tfenv\`.

Tool installation is now handled by the official GitHub Setup Actions:

- [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node)
- [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python)
- [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
- [hashicorp/setup-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform)

These official actions improve compatibility and maintainability, but may result in slightly different behaviors around version resolution or caching.

## Upgrade instructions

No code changes are required for most users.

Version files like \`.nvmrc\`, \`.sdkmanrc\`, and \`.python-version\` are still supported and will continue to work.

However, if you previously relied on custom logic from the removed installers (e.g., local shims, caching behavior), you should validate that workflows behave as expected with the new setup actions.

If you're overriding default versions or using custom tooling logic, we recommend running a test workflow to confirm compatibility.
