# Upgrade from v3 to v4

- `actions-node/lint`: This update changes the action's behavior from just running `eslint` to running an npm script passed by the consumer that would run all the lint checks they need.

## Description of changes

- `actions-node/lint`: The action now takes an input `lint-script`, which is the name of the npm script it is going to run as the primary lint check. The default value of the input is `lint`, meaning the action will run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` depending on the package manager the consumer is using (which is picked up automatically).

## Upgrade instructions

- `actions-node/lint`: If the npm script to lint your code locally is anything other than `lint`, pass it to the `lint-script` input.
